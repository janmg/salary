Overtime Compensation depends on the amount of daily overtime work hours:
Total Daily Pay = Regular Daily Wage + Evening Work Compensation + Overtime Compensations
Regular Daily Wage = Regular Working Hours * Hourly Wage
+$1.15/hour for hours between 18:00 - 06:00

Evening Work Compensation = Evening Hours * Evening Work Compensation

Overtime Compensations[] = Overtime Hours * Overtime Compensation Percent * Hourly Wage

First 2 Hours > 8 Hours = Hourly Wage + 25%
Next 2 Hours = Hourly Wage + 50%
After That = Hourly Wage + 100%
